## Codeforces adventure

``Codeforces`` is a open online platform that hosts competitive programming contests, discussion and offering a wide range of problemset to be solved.

This repository serves as a personal record of the problems I have solved, to track and enhance my programming skills and mindset.

``Mousemice`` is my account's username on the platform.

### Problem set: points for improvement

- [ ] Helpful Maths: Use more eficient sorting algorithms like MergeSort or QuickSort, instead of SelectionSort.
- [ ] I Wanna Be the Guy: Use set datastructure that fits the actual situation to ensure that all levels are unique.
- [ ] Pangram: Use set for the performance, efficiency and readability.
